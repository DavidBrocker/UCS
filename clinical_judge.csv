 You are being asked to participate in a research study conducted by Dr. Kathleen Cino at Farmingdale State College. You must be 18 years of age or older to participate in this research. The purpose of the study is to learn more about clinical judgement development in pre license nursing students. If you consent to participate, you will be asked to provide demographic information, complete a clinical judgement survey about yourself, and answer questions about the effectiveness of the clinical homework assignment known as an unfolding case study.



 Participation will take approximately 30 minutes each semester for up to four semesters (through Fall 2025). If you leave the Nursing program at FSC before Fall 2025 (either by graduating or leaving the program early), your participation in the study will end at that time. Each semester, information (your responses) will be collected through an on-line survey. You will be provided with a random ID code (via email) at the conclusion of your initial participation.

Going forward, you will be requested to enter this ID code each time you participate in this study. A link will be retained between your email address and collected information via this ID code for data analysis purposes; however, only Professor David Brocker will have access to this link. Professor Brocker is a member of the research team, but he is not a member of FSC’s Nursing department. No attempt will be made to identify any participant via their email address and email addresses will not be included with the collected data. You will not be asked to provide any identifiable information other than your email address. Additionally, there is a risk that you could be identified by study team members through the demographic information that will be provided. Although the possibility of identifying you exists, the study team will not intentionally do so, nor will they record any possible identities in the data set.



 There are no risks associated with this research beyond what one would experience in everyday life. Possible benefits of participation in this research include increased awareness of your clinical judgement as it develops over time. There are no compensations for participation. Your participation in this study is voluntary. You will be asked to complete the survey outside of class time. You may choose not to participate in the study or to drop out at any time without consequence. Participating or not participating in this research study will have no impact on your nursing course(s) grade.



 If you have any questions about the research, contact the Principal Investigator at 934-420-2247 or cinok@farmingdale.edu or Farmingdale State College's IRB at 934-420-2687 or IRB@farmingdale.edu.
